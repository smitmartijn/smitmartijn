## Hi there, I'm Martijn 👋

I'm is a proud Dutchman (stroopwafels!) and have spent around 16 years as an IT professional, mostly focused on network operations. Going from web hosting help desk operator, to server support, to third line networking engineer, to data center consultant, to solutions architect. I've been with VMware for 4 years, spending 2,5 years as an NSBU SE in the Benelux and now a Technical Marketing Architect for vRealize Network Insight.

I like to automate and see code come to life. Check out [WhatPulse](https://whatpulse.org) or [PowervRNI](https://powervrni.github.io) as examples of that.
